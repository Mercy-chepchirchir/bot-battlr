# DESCRIPTION
BotCollection and YourBotArmy are container components, which are children of BotPage. BotCollection is where all the bots will be displayed, while YourBotArmy (the pink portion on the top of the screen) will only display the bots that have been selected by the user.

BotCard and BotSpecs are presentational components that have been provided for you that will render out information about an individual bot formatted for a list view and for a full view, respectively. They are pre-styled, and it is your responsibility to get the data into them.

All of the code to style the page has been written for you, meaning that you should be adding to the code rather than editing it.
